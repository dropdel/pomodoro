# Pomodoro App
---
**Requirements**
* Set timer and short and long break timers.
* Customize how long each timer goes on for.
* See a circular progress bar that updates every minute.
* Customize appearance, such as dark mode.

**Frameworks**
* It is fully justifiable to use only vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, as there is little complexity involved in this app. Therefore, no framework.

**Review**
* Pending...

* So far, it works fine. 
* Future Implementations:
  * Fixing the styling for better a better responsive design.
  * Changing the play button styling, for more emphasis.
  * A circular progress bar indicating the percentage finished.
* Obviously, the design would be greatly enhanced with a css framework, but, as was stated earlier, unnecessary for a project of this limited scope.
